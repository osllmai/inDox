# MetaCLIP Documentation

## Overview

MetaCLIP is an advanced image classification model developed by Meta AI. It is designed for high-performance classification tasks by leveraging the power of CLIP-based vision-language models. This classifier is optimized for diverse applications, including general image recognition and domain-specific classification.

## Key Features

- **CLIP-Based Model**: Integrates CLIP's vision-language understanding for semantic classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Trained on extensive datasets for enhanced recognition capabilities.
- **Custom Labels**: Allows defining custom label sets for domain-specific classification.
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently classifies multiple images at once.
- **Visualization**: Generates probability bar plots for intuitive classification results.

## Quick Start

### Single Image Classification

```python
from indoxminer.classification import MetaCLIP
from PIL import Image

# Initialize classifier
classifier = MetaCLIP()

# Load an image
image = Image.open("/path/to/image.jpg")

# Classify the image with default labels
classifier.classify(image)
```

### Batch Image Classification

```python
# Load multiple images
images = [Image.open("/path/to/image1.jpg"), Image.open("/path/to/image2.jpg")]

# Classify the batch of images
classifier.classify(images)
```

### Custom Labels

```python
# Define custom labels
labels = ["a cat", "a dog", "a bird"]

# Classify the image with custom labels
classifier.classify(image, labels=labels)
```

## Advanced Features

### Customizable Workflows

MetaCLIP allows users to interact with its internal components for fine-tuned control.

```python
# Preprocess the image and labels
inputs = classifier.preprocess(image, labels)

# Predict probabilities
probs = classifier.predict(inputs)

# Visualize results
classifier.visualize(image, labels, probs, top=5)
```

### Model-Specific Capabilities

- Optimized for vision-language tasks with CLIP-based representations.
- Fine-tuned for diverse classification scenarios.
- Strong adaptability to various domains including research and commercial applications.

## Example Use Cases

- **Social Media Content Moderation**: Automate image categorization and compliance checks.
- **Healthcare Imaging**: Leverage AI-powered classification for medical diagnostics.
- **E-commerce**: Enhance product categorization based on visual descriptions.

## Visualization

The `classify` method generates bar plots displaying predicted probabilities, aiding interpretability.

## Why Use MetaCLIP?

- Powerful CLIP-based classification capabilities.
- Supports custom labels and batch processing.
- Suitable for diverse, domain-specific applications.
