# BioCLIP

## Overview

BioCLIP is a specialized image classification model designed for biological image analysis. It leverages CLIPâ€™s vision-language capabilities to categorize biological data efficiently, making it an essential tool for researchers, healthcare professionals, and bioinformatics applications.

## Key Features

- **Optimized for Biological Images**: Designed specifically for analyzing medical and biological datasets.
- **Pretrained CLIP Model**: Utilizes advanced vision-language techniques for precise classification.
- **Custom Labels**: Supports user-defined labels for domain-specific tasks.
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes multiple images at once.
- **Visualization**: Generates bar plots for an intuitive understanding of classification results.

## Quick Start

### Single Image Classification

```python
from indoxminer.classification import BioCLIP
from PIL import Image

# Initialize classifier
classifier = BioCLIP()

# Load an image
image = Image.open("/path/to/image.jpg")

# Classify the image with default labels
classifier.classify(image)
```

### Batch Image Classification

```python
# Load multiple images
images = [Image.open("/path/to/image1.jpg"), Image.open("/path/to/image2.jpg")]

# Classify the batch of images
classifier.classify(images)
```

### Custom Labels

```python
# Define custom labels
labels = ["cancerous cell", "healthy tissue", "bacterial colony"]

# Classify the image with custom labels
classifier.classify(image, labels=labels)
```

## Advanced Features

### Customizable Workflows

BioCLIP allows users to interact with individual components for greater control over analysis.

```python
# Preprocess the image and labels
inputs = classifier.preprocess(image, labels)

# Predict probabilities
probs = classifier.predict(inputs)

# Visualize results
classifier.visualize(image, labels, probs, top=5)
```

### Model-Specific Capabilities

- Tailored for biomedical applications, ensuring high relevance in research.
- Recognizes complex biological structures with domain-specific fine-tuning.
- Supports integration with medical imaging systems.

## Example Use Cases

- **Medical Research**: Categorize histology and pathology images.
- **Bioinformatics**: Analyze cellular structures in microscopy images.
- **Healthcare Applications**: Assist in disease detection through AI-powered classification.

## Visualization

The `classify` method generates bar plots displaying predicted probabilities, helping researchers interpret results effectively.

## Why Use BioCLIP?

- Specially designed for biological and medical imaging.
- Supports custom classification tasks in research and healthcare.
- Provides visual insights into classification outcomes.
