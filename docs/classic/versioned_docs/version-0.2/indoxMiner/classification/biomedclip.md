# BiomedCLIP

## Overview

BiomedCLIP is a specialized image classification model tailored for biomedical imaging tasks. It utilizes CLIP's vision-language capabilities, fine-tuned for medical and healthcare applications, making it ideal for analyzing X-rays, MRIs, pathology slides, and other biomedical images.

## Key Features

- **Optimized for Biomedical Imaging**: Designed for classifying medical scans, histology slides, and biological microscopy images.
- **Pretrained CLIP Model**: Uses advanced vision-language techniques for high-accuracy classification.
- **Custom Labels**: Allows users to define medical-specific labels for classification tasks.
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently classifies multiple biomedical images in a single call.
- **Visualization**: Generates probability bar plots for an intuitive understanding of classification results.

## Quick Start

### Single Image Classification

```python
from indoxminer.classification import BiomedCLIP
from PIL import Image

# Initialize classifier
classifier = BiomedCLIP()

# Load an image
image = Image.open("/path/to/medical_image.jpg")

# Classify the image with default labels
classifier.classify(image)
```

### Batch Image Classification

```python
# Load multiple images
images = [Image.open("/path/to/image1.jpg"), Image.open("/path/to/image2.jpg")]

# Classify the batch of images
classifier.classify(images)
```

### Custom Labels

```python
# Define custom labels
labels = ["tumor", "normal tissue", "infection"]

# Classify the image with custom labels
classifier.classify(image, labels=labels)
```

## Advanced Features

### Customizable Workflows

BiomedCLIP allows users to interact with individual components for more precise control over medical image analysis.

```python
# Preprocess the image and labels
inputs = classifier.preprocess(image, labels)

# Predict probabilities
probs = classifier.predict(inputs)

# Visualize results
classifier.visualize(image, labels, probs, top=5)
```

### Model-Specific Capabilities

- Fine-tuned for medical imaging datasets.
- Recognizes patterns in radiology, histopathology, and cellular microscopy images.
- Supports integration with clinical decision-support systems.

## Example Use Cases

- **Radiology**: Assist in detecting abnormalities in X-ray, CT, and MRI scans.
- **Pathology**: Classify tissue samples in histological studies.
- **Medical Research**: Automate classification of biological images for AI-powered analysis.

## Visualization

The `classify` method generates bar plots displaying predicted probabilities, helping medical professionals interpret results effectively.
