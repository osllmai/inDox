The key idea is to enhance the generative capabilities of a language model by incorporating relevant information retrieved from a database or a vector store. \n",
    " AgenticRag is designed to provide more contextually rich and accurate responses by utilizing external knowledge sources. It retrieves relevant pieces of information (chunks) from a vector store based on a query and then uses a language model to generate a comprehensive response that incorporates this retrieved information."
