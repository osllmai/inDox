    "# Using GithubReader for Accessing Files from GitHub\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use the `GithubReader` class for accessing files from GitHub repositories. The `GithubReader` class interacts with the GitHub API to retrieve file content and metadata, which can be useful for various applications including research and question-answering systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, ensure you have your GitHub personal access token ready for authentication. This token is crucial for accessing private repositories and ensuring secure interactions with the GitHub API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, ensure you have set up your environment variables and API keys in Python using the dotenv library. This is crucial for securely managing sensitive information, such as API keys, especially when using services like HuggingFace. Ensure your `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` is defined in the `.env` file to avoid hardcoding sensitive data into your codebase, thus enhancing security and maintainability.\n",

Is it a feature, a bug, or a refactor?\\n\\n- If it\\'s a bug: The branch name should start with the word \"issue\".\\n- If it\\'s a feature: The branch name should start with the word \"feature\".\\n- If it\\'s a refactor: The branch name should start with the word \"refactor\".\\n- If it\\'s for documentation : The branch name should start with the word \"docs\".\\n### Note 2: Creating a Pull Request\\n\\nFor every branch you create, you need to make a pull request at the end of development. However, there are some rules:\\n\\n1. Ensure your code adheres to a set of technical guidelines before creating the pull request. This includes following coding standards and running all necessary tests.\\n2. Write detailed descriptions for the pull request. This should include  an explanation of the issue solved and what you did.\\n3. Limit your changes to no more than 10 files to make the review process easier. If there are more changes, split them into multiple branches and pull requests.\\n4. At least one review and approval are necessary before you can merge the pull request.\\n5. It\\'s best if the whole team reviews the code. If someone thinks the code can be improved, they should comment. If the comment is reasonable, the request owner should update the code. If they can\\'t agree, they should hold a meeting with other team members to discuss and present their reasons. After any corrections, the code is reviewed again. If there are no further issues, it gets approved, the branch is merged, and then the branch is deleted.\\n6. After merging, make sure to clean up by deleting the branch to keep the repository tidy.\\n',\n",

       " '# CustomEvaluator\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe `CustomEvaluator` class is designed to evaluate various aspects of language model outputs using a range of metrics. It\\nsupports metrics such as Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy, Bias, Contextual Relevancy, GEval, Hallucination, Knowledge\\nRetention, Toxicity, BertScore, BLEU, Rouge, and METEOR. This class is ideal for assessing different dimensions of model\\nperformance and ensuring comprehensive evaluation.\\n\\n## Initialization\\n\\nThe `CustomEvaluator` class is initialized with two main components:\\n\\n- **Model**: The language model to be evaluated.\\n- **Metrics**: A list of metric instances used to evaluate the model.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```python\\nclass CustomEvaluator:\\n    def __init__(self, model, metrics: List):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Initializes the Evaluator with a language model and a list of metrics.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            model: The language model to be evaluated.\\n            metrics (List): A list of metric instances to evaluate the model.\\n        \"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n## Setting the Model for Metrics\\n\\nThe `set_model_for_metrics` method ensures that the language model is properly set for each metric that requires it.\\nThis step is crucial for metrics that need direct access to the model for evaluation purposes.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```python\\ndef set_model_for_metrics(self):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Sets the language model for each metric that requires it.\\n    \"\"\"\\n```\\n\\nIn this method, the `Evaluator` class iterates through each metric in the `metrics` list. If a metric has a `set_model`\\nmethod, it is called with the `model` attribute, ensuring that each metric can access the necessary language model.\\n\\n## Evaluation Process\\n\\nThe `evaluate` method performs the evaluation using the provided metrics. It iterates through each metric, performs the\\nevaluation, and stores the results in a dictionary. The method includes error handling to ensure that any issues\\nencountered during evaluation are logged.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```python\\ndef judge(self):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Evaluates the language model using the provided metrics and returns the results.\\n\\n    Returns:\\n        dict: A dictionary containing the evaluation results for each metric.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    results = {}\\n    for metric in self.metrics:\\n        metric_name = metric.__class__.__name__\\n        try:\\n            logger.info(f\"Evaluating metric: {metric_name}\")\\n            # Example for Faithfulness metric\\n            if isinstance(metric, Faithfulness):\\n                claims = metric.evaluate_claims()\\n                truths = metric.evaluate_truths()\\n                verdicts = metric.evaluate_verdicts(claims.claims)\\n                reason = metric.evaluate_reason(verdicts, truths.truths)\\n                results[\\'faithfulness\\'] = {\\n                    \\'claims\\': claims.claims,\\n                    \\'truths\\': truths.truths,\\n                    \\'verdicts\\': [verdict.__dict__ for verdict in verdicts.verdicts],\\n                    \\'reason\\': reason.reason\\n                }\\n            # Additional metrics (Answer Relevancy, Bias, etc.) follow a similar pattern.\\n            logger.info(f\"Completed evaluation for metric: {metric_name}\")\\n        except Exception as e:\\n            logger.error(f\"Error evaluating metric {metric_name}: {str(e)}\")\\n    return results\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the Evaluator class method evaluate initializes an empty dictionary called results. It iterates through\\neach metric in the metrics list, retrieves the metric\\'s name, and logs the start of the evaluation process. For each\\nmetric, the method checks its type and calls the appropriate evaluation method. For instance, the Faithfulness metric\\ninvolves evaluating claims, truths, and verdicts, which are then stored in the results dictionary under the \\'\\nfaithfulness\\' key.\\n\\nIf any exceptions are encountered during the evaluation process, they are caught and logged as errors, and the\\nevaluation continues with the next metric. The final results are returned as a dictionary containing the outcomes of the\\nevaluations for each metric.',\n",
       " '# LLMComparison\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe `LLMComparison` class is designed to facilitate the comparison of multiple language models based on their evaluation metrics. This class allows for visual representation of the performance of different models, making it easier to analyze and compare their strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n## Initialization\\n\\nThe `LLMComparison` class is initialized with a list of models, where each model is represented by a dictionary containing its name, overall score, and various evaluation metrics.\\n\\n### Example\\n\\n```python\\nclass LLMComparison:\\n    def __init__(self, models):\\n        \"\"\"\\n        Initializes the LLMComparison with a list of models.\\n\\n        Args:\\n            models (list): A list of dictionaries where each dictionary contains\\n                           the model\\'s name, score, and metrics.\\n        \"\"\"\\n```\\n\\n## Plotting the Comparison\\n\\nThe plot method generates a visual representation of the comparison between the models. It uses an external visualization library to create graphs that illustrate the performance of each model across various metrics.
