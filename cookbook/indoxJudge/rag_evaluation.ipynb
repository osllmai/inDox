    "- **Plotting Evaluation Metrics:** This line generates visual plots of the evaluation metrics using the `plot` method of the `evaluator` object. The plots provide a graphical representation of the model's performance across different metrics, making it easier to analyze and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dash UI Interface:** When `mode=\"external\"` is used, this will open a Dash UI in a new browser window or tab to display the evaluation metrics plots interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Colab Users:** If you are using Google Colab, it is recommended to set `mode=\"inline\"` instead. This will render the plots directly within the notebook, making it more convenient for users working in an online environment like Colab.\n"
