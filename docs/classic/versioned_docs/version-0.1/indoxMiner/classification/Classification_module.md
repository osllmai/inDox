## üöÄ Quick Start

Here‚Äôs how you can get started with the **SigCLIP** model for image classification:

### Single Image Classification

```python
from indoxminer.classification import SigCLIPClassifier
from PIL import Image

# Initialize SigCLIP classifier
classifier = SigCLIPClassifier()

# Load an image
image = Image.open("/path/to/image.jpg")

# Classify the image with default labels
classifier.classify(image)
```

### Batch Image Classification

```python
# Load multiple images
images = [Image.open("/path/to/image1.jpg"), Image.open("/path/to/image2.jpg")]

# Classify the batch of images
classifier.classify(images)
```

### Custom Labels

```python
# Define custom labels
labels = ["a cat", "a dog", "a bird"]

# Classify the image with custom labels
classifier.classify(image, labels=labels)
```

---

## üîç Advanced Features

### Customizable Workflows

The module allows users to directly interact with its components (`preprocess`, `predict`, `visualize`) for complete control over the classification pipeline.

```python
# Preprocess the image and labels
inputs = classifier.preprocess(image, labels)

# Predict probabilities
probs = classifier.predict(inputs)

# Visualize the results
classifier.visualize(image, labels, probs, top=5)
```

### Model-Specific Capabilities

Each classifier is optimized for its respective model, ensuring that unique features like **specialized tokenization** or **domain-specific fine-tuning** are fully utilized.

## üåê Example Use Cases

1. **E-commerce**: Automatically classify product images into predefined categories.
2. **Healthcare**: Analyze biological images with BioCLIP for medical research.
3. **Remote Sensing**: Identify features in satellite images using RemoteCLIP.
4. **Content Moderation**: Classify images for compliance and moderation workflows.
5. **Mobile Applications**: Leverage MobileCLIP for lightweight classification on mobile devices.
