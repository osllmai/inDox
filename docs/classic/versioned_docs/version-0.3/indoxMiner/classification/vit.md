# ViT

## Overview

ViT is an implementation of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model within IndoxMiner. It provides powerful image classification capabilities by leveraging self-attention mechanisms, making it suitable for a wide range of classification tasks, from general image recognition to domain-specific applications.

## Key Features

- **Transformer-Based Model**: Uses attention mechanisms instead of convolutions for improved performance on large datasets.
- **High Accuracy**: Pretrained on large-scale datasets for robust classification.
- **Custom Labels**: Define custom label sets for tailored classification needs.
- **Batch Processing**: Classifies multiple images efficiently.
- **Visualization**: Generates bar plots to intuitively interpret classification results.

## Quick Start

### Single Image Classification

```python
from indoxminer.classification import ViT
from PIL import Image

# Initialize classifier
classifier = ViT()

# Load an image
image = Image.open("/path/to/image.jpg")

# Classify the image with default labels
classifier.classify(image)
```

### Batch Image Classification

```python
# Load multiple images
images = [Image.open("/path/to/image1.jpg"), Image.open("/path/to/image2.jpg")]

# Classify the batch of images
classifier.classify(images)
```

### Custom Labels

```python
# Define custom labels
labels = ["a cat", "a dog", "a bird"]

# Classify the image with custom labels
classifier.classify(image, labels=labels)
```

## Advanced Features

### Customizable Workflows

ViT allows direct interaction with its components for enhanced flexibility.

```python
# Preprocess the image and labels
inputs = classifier.preprocess(image, labels)

# Predict probabilities
probs = classifier.predict(inputs)

# Visualize results
classifier.visualize(image, labels, probs, top=5)
```

### Model-Specific Capabilities

- Utilizes a transformer architecture for improved feature extraction.
- Works well with large datasets and complex images.
- Adaptable to various classification tasks, from general vision to specialized domains.

## Example Use Cases

- **E-commerce**: Automate product classification for online catalogs.
- **Healthcare**: Assist in medical image analysis for research purposes.
- **Security**: Identify and categorize images in surveillance applications.

## Visualization

The `classify` method generates bar plots displaying predicted probabilities, aiding in model interpretability.

## Why Use ViT?

- State-of-the-art transformer-based classification model.
- Customizable label sets for flexible use cases.
- Scalable batch processing for large datasets.
